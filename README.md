`godyl` helps with batch-downloading and installing statically compiled binaries from:

- GitHub releases
- URLs
- Go projects

As an alternative to above, custom commands can be used as well.

`godyl` will infer the platform and architecture from the system it is running on, and will attempt to download the appropriate binary.

This uses simple heuristics to select the correct binary to download, and will not work for all projects.

However, most properties can be overridden, with `hints` and `skip` used to help `godyl` make the correct decision.

> [!WARNING]
> This repo is a work in progress!
> Needing both cleaning up and documenting.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project serves as a learning exercise for Go and its surrounding ecosystem and tooling.
> As such, it might be of limited use for others, but feel free to use it if you find it useful.

> [!NOTE]
> Tested on:
>
> **Linux**: `amd64`, `arm64`, `armv7`
>
> **Windows**: `amd64`
>
> **MacOS**: `amd64`, `arm64`
>
> for tools listed in [tools.yml](./tools.yml)

## Installation

### From source

```sh
go install github.com/idelchi/godyl/cmd/godyl@latest
```

## From installation script

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idelchi/godyl/refs/heads/dev/install.sh | sh -s -- -v v0.2-beta -d ~/.local/bin
```

## Update

```sh
godyl --update
```

## Usage

Use together with `yaml` file:

```sh
godyl tools.yml  --output ./bin
```

Or use to download a single tool:

```sh
godyl idelchi/godyl --output ./bin
```

When used to download a single tool, the `mode` will be set to `extract` by default.

Override `os` and `arch` to download a specific binary:

```sh
godyl idelchi/godyl --os linux --arch amd64 --output ./bin
```

> [!NOTE]
> Set up a GitHub API token to avoid rate limiting when using `github` as a source type.
> See [configuration](#configuration) for more information, or simply `export GODYL_GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>`

## Configuration

The tools can be configured (in order of priority) by

- flags
- environment variables
- `.env` file

The following flags and their corresponding environment variables are available:

| Flag               | Environment Variable  | Default        | Description                                    |

| `--show-platform`  | `GODYL_SHOW_PLATFORM` | `false`        | Detect the platform and exit                   |
| `--update`         | `GODYL_UPDATE`        | `false`        | Update `godyl` itself                          |
| `--dry`            | `GODYL_DRY`           | `false`        | Run without making any changes (dry run)       |
| `--log`            | `GODYL_LOG`           | `info`         | Log level (debug, info, warn, error)           |

| `--output`         | `GODYL_OUTPUT`        | `""`           | Output path for the downloaded tools           |
| `--tags`, `-t`     | `GODYL_TAGS`          | `["!native"]`  | Tags to filter tools by. Use `!` to exclude    |
| `--source`         | `GODYL_SOURCE`        | `github`       | Source from which to install the tools         |
| `--strategy`       | `GODYL_STRATEGY`      | `none`         | Strategy to use for updating tools             |
| `--os`             | `GODYL_OS`            | `""`           | Operating system to use for downloading        |
| `--arch`           | `GODYL_ARCH`          | `""`           | Architecture to use for downloading            |
| `--github-token`   | `GODYL_GITHUB_TOKEN`  | `""`           | GitHub token for authentication                |

The path to the file containing the tool installation instructions is provided as a positional argument, defaulting to `tools.yml`.

An example [tools.yml](./tools.yml) is provided.

In general, settings can be set in the following ways (order of priority):

- as a field in the [tools.yml](./tools.yml) definition

  ```yaml
  output: ~/.local/bin
  ```

- as a flag to the tool

  ```sh
  godyl --output ~/.local/bin
  ```

- as an environment variable

  ```sh
  GODYL_OUTPUT=~/.local/bin godyl
  ```

- in an `.env` file

  ```
  GODYL_OUTPUT=~/.local/bin
  ```

- by setting the value in a `defaults.yml` file (see [defaults](#defaults))

  ```yaml
  output: ~/.local/bin
  ```

If none of the above are fulfilled, the default configuration embedded from [defaults.yml](./cmd/godyl/defaults.yml) will be used.

## Tools

A YAML file controls the tools to download and install. Alternatively, if the positional argument to the tool is not a YAML file, it will be treated as a single tool name or URL.

Examples are provided in [tools.yml](./tools.yml).

### Simple form

```yaml
- idelchi/godyl
```

Above is the `simple` form to attempt to download the latest release of `godyl` from `idelchi/godyl`.

If it is a URL, it will be considered as a `source.url` type.
Otherwise, it will be assumed to be a `source.github` type on the form `owner/repo`.

### Full form

```yaml
name: string
description: string
version: string
path: string
output: string
exe:
  name: string
  patterns:
    - regex
platform:
  os: string
  architecture:
    type: string
    version: string
  library: string
  extension: string
  distribution: string
aliases: []
values: {}
fallbacks: []
hints:
  - pattern: regex
    weight: string
    must: boolean
source:
  type: string
  github:
    repo: string
    owner: string
    token: string
  url:
    url: string
    token: string
  go:
    command: string
  commands: []
tags:
  - string
strategy: string
extensions:
  - string
skip:
  - condition: string
    reason: string
post: []
mode: string
env:
  key: string
```

Any field that accepts a list, can also be provided as a string.

For example:

```yaml
aliases: gd
fallbacks: go
exe:
  patterns: "{{ .Exe }}{{ .EXTENSION }}$"
```

is equivalent to:

```yaml
aliases:
  - gd
fallbacks:
  - go
exe:
  patterns:
    - "{{ .Exe }}{{ .EXTENSION }}$"
```

and

```yaml
skip:
  reason: "tool is not available on windows"
  condition: '{{ eq .OS "windows" }}'
```

is equivalent to:

```yaml
skip:
  - reason: "tool is not available on windows"
    condition: '{{ eq .OS "windows" }}'
```

A default configuration may be used to specify default settings for all tools. These will override (or extend in some case) the settings for each tool.

The following is embedded and used by default if no default configuration is provided:

[defaults.yml](./cmd/godyl/defaults.yml)

The example above defines:

- The default output directory for all tools (`~/.local/bin`)
- Patterns to use for when searching for the executable

  - `^{{ .Exe }}{{ .EXTENSION }}$`
  - `.\*/{{ .Exe }}{{ .EXTENSION }}$`

- Hints to:

  - use the executable name as a pattern (useful for repositories with multiple binaries, such as `ahmetb/kubectx`)

    ```yaml
    pattern: "{{ .Exe }}"
    weight: 1
    ```

  - prefer `.zip` files for Windows

    ```yaml
    pattern: zip
    weight: '{{ if eq .OS "windows" }}1{{ else }}0{{ end }}'
    ```

  - prefer the three last versions of the arm architecture, in descending order
    ```
    - pattern: "armv{{.ARCH_VERSION}}"
      weight: 3
    - pattern: "armv{{sub .ARCH_VERSION 1}}"
      weight: 2
    - pattern: "armv{{sub .ARCH_VERSION 2}}"
      weight: 1
    ```

- Extensions to use when filtering assets

  - `.exe` for Windows, empty for Linux and MacOS
  - `.zip` for Windows and Darwin
  - `.tar.gz` for all platforms

- `find` mode for downloading, extracting and finding the executable
- The default source type as `github`
- `none` strategy to skip tools which already exist
- Settings the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` to the value of `GODYL_GITHUB_TOKEN`

The full set of default options are:

```yaml
exe:
output:
platform:
values:
fallbacks:
hints:
source:
tags:
strategy:
env:
mode:
```

For reference full reference of what values you can set, see the [tools](#tools) section.

## Template overview

All functions available in the [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) library are available for use in templates.

### Variables

The following table lists the available template variables, where they may be used, and their descriptions:

## Notes

All `regex` expressions are evaluated using `search`, meaning that `^` and `$` are necessary to match the start and end of the string.
When running `32-bit` userland on a `64-bit` Kernel, there's some attempts to infer the matching `32-bit` architecture.

However, to be certain that the right binary is downloaded, it's recommended to pass the `--arch` flag to the tool.
